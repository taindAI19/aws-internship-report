### Overall assessment

**1. Working environment**
The working atmosphere at FCJ is friendly and easy to integrate. Everyone supports each other enthusiastically, even when I need help outside of working hours. The working space is clean and comfortable, creating conditions for good concentration. I think the company can organize more internal exchanges or group activities to increase connection between members.

**2. Support from mentor / admin team**
Mentor explains in detail, is patient and always encourages me to ask questions when I am not clear about the problem. The admin team quickly supports the necessary procedures and documents, helping me get into the rhythm of work smoothly. What I like most is that the mentor lets me experiment and solve problems myself before instructing.

**3. The level of suitability between work and major**
The assigned tasks are quite close to the knowledge I learned in school, and at the same time help me approach new content. Thanks to that, I not only consolidate my basic knowledge but also learn practical skills that have not been mentioned in the curriculum.

**4. Opportunities to learn and develop skills**
During the internship, I was trained in many skills such as team coordination, task management, using professional working tools and how to communicate in the office environment. The mentor also shared very useful practical experiences to orient my future career.

**5. Culture & Teamwork Spirit**
I feel the company culture is positive: respect each other, support each other wholeheartedly and work in a comfortable but still professional atmosphere. When there is an urgent project, everyone cooperates to complete the common goal, regardless of position or role. This makes me feel welcome even though I am just an intern.

**6. Internship policy/benefits**
The company has an internship allowance and is quite flexible in terms of time when interns need to adjust. In addition, being able to participate in internal training sessions is also a big plus.

### Some other questions
- During the internship, what made you **most satisfied**?
I am most satisfied with the good support environment and the very dedicated mentor.
- What do you think the company can **improve** to better support interns?
Assign work according to professional capacity so that students have the opportunity to handle it themselves, thereby learning many practical skills. Many missing documents need to be supplemented.
- If you have friends who are interested, would you **recommend them to intern here**? Why?
Yes. Because of the friendly environment, enthusiastic mentor, work that suits the major and helps to learn quickly in practice.

### Suggestions & wishes
- Do you have any ideas to improve the internship experience?
There should be a separate onboarding session for new interns to get acquainted with the process and tools faster.
- Do you want to continue participating in this program if you have the opportunity?
Yes. Because the program brings many practical experiences and development opportunities.
- Additional suggestions (feel free to share):
I appreciate the current working environment. If there are more periodic in-depth workshops, the experience will be even better.
